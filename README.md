# MIPS-SIMULATOR
it reads and executes assembly language programs

used - c++

implemented in three phases-
phase 1 -  A simple c++ program which reads an assembly file and execute instruction one-by-one
           and at the end show resisters, there's values and data memory.
phase 2 -  Modified version of phase 1 where we use pipeline processing in five steps
           Instruction fetch(IF),instruction decode(ID),instruction execute(EX),Memory access(M),Write back(WB)
           and at the end show resisters, there's values and data memory.
phase 3 -  Modified version of phase 2 where we use cache 
           and at the end show resisters, there's values and data memory.
